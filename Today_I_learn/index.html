            <li class="n1">Master one or two of the core technologies!</li>
                <div id="explanation">
                    With the amount of technologies available, trying to master all of them would be almost impossible to do.
                </div>
            <li class="n1">Chat with experts!</li>
                <div id="explanation">
                    It's always good to have an expert to consult with, after all experiences are better than theories.
                </div>
        </ul>

            <li class="n2">Consistent indentations!</li>
            <div id="explanation">Who doesn't want a pretty looking code block, right?</div>
